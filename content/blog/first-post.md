this is the first post on my website's blog.... yay? not much to say really, have just been spending the past few days working on the underlying Hugo code and config for this site.

i'm quite excited to finally have a website i am fully happy with and will hopefully be quite future-proof. :)

in other news, i got my grant for my [midi sequencer](/projects/hardware/dna) recently, and have ordered all the parts & pcbs for the project! can't wait until it finally arrives and i can finally start building the project, it's def gonna be fun and i will make plenty of posts here documenting the process...
